Not only do we get to see the sigh of relief from Rodgers, we also get to hear his usual big word filling post match interviews again. It’s not exactly “hysteria” when your senior squad failed to break the defence of a team that worth less than a tenth of yours and leaked the most goals while playing two tiers below, now is it?

Well at least he finally gave in and starts playing two up front, at home facing an Aston Villa team that also just lost two in a row, and let Ings plays his natural position. And he better makes sure he buys Sturridge a big lunch, in addition to the warm handshake and pat in the back.

The result only amplifies the vital importance of Sturridge in this team, even after all the money spent on the attackers they brought in after the sale of Suarez. It’s apparent that he’s not even close to fit, yet Rodgers just can’t afford to not play him the full 90 minutes. Let’s just hope there won’t be any set back this time around.

With two mobile forwards up front, especially one of them is full of energy and kin on pressing, and allowing Coutinho to actually play the number 10 role that he’s wearing, the attack is much more fluent and improved. That, and the early goal, also seems to help Milner, and after some time, Lucas to pick back up their confidence and standard of play, which is critical especially now with Henderson out for an extended period of time. The only one that might not be benefitting from this is probably Emre Can, who’s once more found himself playing the right center back of a back three. However, I don’t think Rodgers has much choices as Moreno just seems more like a midfield than a fullback.

Now the battle gets tougher, Merseyside derby away next week and with trips to White Hart Lane and Stamford Bridge on the horizon, especially with the Spurs looking inform after trashing Man City and Costa should be back and hungry when the team faces Chelsea. Let’s hope Rodgers can still be able to put aside the “hysteria” after the stretch.
